the Prototype Design Pattern gives us a way to
create new or cloned objects from the existing object of a class.

Prototype:  This is going to be an interface or
			abstract class that is used for the types of objects that can be cloned itself.
			In our example, it is going to be the Employee Abstract Class.
ConcretePrototype: This is going to be the class that implements the Prototype abstract class
			or interface for cloning itself. In our example, it is going to be the PermanetEmployee and 
			TemporaryEmployee Classes.
Client: The client is nothing but the class that creates a new object 
			by asking a prototype to clone itself.
